                <h3>Industry Background and User Problems</h3>
                <p>
                  The trucking industry has a handful of problems. One is it's
                  astonishingly high driver turnover due to drivers jumping from
                  fleet to fleet for very slight pay bumps and not feeling they
                  are treated well. Two, many trucking fleets still use excel
                  spreadsheets to track all of their data. This can easily get
                  out of hand when a fleet has just a few hundred drivers
                  because there are several silioed data systems, federal
                  required documents, and recording of events like inspections,
                  violations, collisions, etc. Lastly, events like collisions
                  with other vehicles can easily get up to tens of thousands of
                  dollars in fees and a mound of paper work for the fleet's
                  safety team.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Idelic's Watch List uses Machine Learning to analyze a truck
                  driver's risk level on the road by looking at an array of
                  factors including (but not limited to) previous collisions,
                  road violations, hours of service violations, and telematics
                  alerts (speeding, harsh braking, harsh cornering).
                </p>
                <h3>Design Challenges</h3>
                <p>Some challenges included:</p>
                <ol id="briefList">
                  <li>
                    Balance between user needs and blowing up development
                    effort.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Balance between volume of data and cognitive overload.
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h2 class="projectSection">Task</h2>
                <p>
                  The task was to create a new more robust, yet simple workflow
                  that enabled a fleet's safety team to:
                </p>
                <ol id="briefList">
                  <li>Identify the fleet's riskest drivers.</li>
                  <li>Briefly analyze that driver's history.</li>
                  <li>
                    Assign a performance improvement plan. Performance
                    improvement plans (previous UX project with Idelic) are
                    prestrictive plans with multi-step, multi-touch engages
                    between the driver and their manager to work the driver's
                    their root issue.
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h2 class="projectSection">Research</h2>
                <h3>Interviews</h3>
                <p>
                  Although requirements around user permissions can vary by
                  fleet, we believed mostly upper management (VP of the Safety
                  team) would be using this feature based on previous findings
                  from other features, persona behaviors, and persona
                  responsibiliies. At the same time we were exploring the idea
                  of putting a condensed view of the Watch List on a Executive
                  Dashboard (See KPI Dashboard for more details on this
                  project). Because of this we conducted phone interviews with
                  them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  4 different interviews were conducted with upper management of
                  varying types of trucking fleets. Findings confirmed that a
                  condensed version of the Watch List should be on the user's
                  dashboard due to their limited time. Also, finding pointed to
                  some of the key factors managers look for when assessing a
                  driver's behavior. Some include collisions and telematic
                  events.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h2 class="projectSection">Iteration 1</h2>
                <h3>Designing Reasoning</h3>
                <p>
                  Because some fleets have so many drivers, they'll need to go
                  through them very efficiently. Thus the first iteration
                  enabled the user to complete the entire workflow (viewing
                  riskest drivers, analyzing behavior, and taking action) from
                  the dashboard. This was done by clicking on a driver, which
                  opens a modal like side panel from Microsoft's Office Fabric
                  UI library. Or if desired, they could go a separate deticated
                  screen to view the Watch List full window width.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So first, the user would look at the list of drivers and
                  select a driver based on the safety score given by the machine
                  learning model. Next, they would view the driver's history and
                  determine what their root issues. Last, the user would go
                  through a step by step wizard to sign a performance
                  improvement plan.
                </p>
                <h3>Findings From Testing</h3>
                <p>
                  5 users were tested from varying companies. Findings showed
                  that the ability to assign prescriptive plans in a highly
                  formated manner via a step by step wizard UI were highly
                  desired. However, the modal panel pattern was constraining in
                  terms of space and would overlap the Watch List itself when
                  triggered. Additionally, it was found being explicit in
                  labeling just very neccassary as many users questioned certain
                  parts of graphs and other smaller UI elements. Lastly, it was
                  noted that users might want to be to esculate the employee's
                  disciplinary status and assign a letter, which is common in
                  trucking fleets. Letters inform the driver of what they did
                  wrong and require written confirmation from the driver that
                  they've recieved it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Overall, findings indicated we were on the correct path.
                  Several participants enthusiastically replied "Yes!" when
                  asked if they would be like to stay in the loop on the
                  features progress and providing additional insight.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h2 class="projectSection">Iteration 2</h2>
                <h3>Design Reasoning</h3>
                <p>
                  Due to the constrains of the modal panel, it was decided to
                  still have the Watch List on the Dashboard (user task 1);
                  however, analyzing (user task 2) and prescribing a plan (user
                  task 3) were moved.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Inspired by some other B2B UIs, a new idea came about to click
                  on a driver and the table shrinks to a list. This gave enough
                  room to display the driver's information and transition to a
                  wizard UI on the right side, yet still enabling the user to
                  see where the driver was in relation to others on the Watch
                  List. Now, if users clicked on the header they would see a
                  full width data table of the Watch List on a new screen and
                  then clicking a driver would trigger the table become a list
                  and show the driver info. If users clicks on a driver, then it
                  directs them to the new page, but would already trigger the
                  animation to show the Watch List as a condensed list and open
                  the driver's profile. Plus, an additional step was added to
                  the wizard, to allow the user to esculate the driver's
                  disciplinary status. Lastly, additional labeling was added.
                </p>
                <h3>Findings From Testing</h3>
                <p>
                  Some users were involved in testing and there were no
                  questions evolving around labeling. There was a concern that
                  the new idea on animation and splitting the screen would cause
                  some cognitive overload, leading to confusion; however, users
                  followed along just fine. Additionally, there was a concern
                  users would have difficulties with how telematic alerts
                  (speeding, harsh braking, harsh cornering) are displayed since
                  they can occur VERY frequently. However, the new condensed
                  viewing of telematics enabled the user to dive deeper if
                  needed.

                <h3>Industry Background</h3>
                <p>
                  First, CDL drivers have a lot of federal regulations they have
                  to abide by, which requires certain certifications and
                  training. This also requires the company’s safety team to keep
                  track if those drivers are up-to-date. If they don’t and the
                  driver gets into pulled over, this can result in higher fines;
                  the vehicle becoming out of service (OoS) which prevents
                  completion of a delivery; or even a negative impact on the
                  company’s CSA score. Although the Federal Motor Carrier Safety
                  Administration (FMCSA) is looking to move from the CSA score
                  to an IRT model, this can potentially still hurt a company’s
                  score.
                </p>
                <h3>User Problems</h3>
                <p>
                  Previous iterations of the training module only let a user
                  certify/pass a driver one by one, which would take an hour or
                  more for a trainer or manager to go through training classes
                  that had 50 or more drivers. On top of this, fleets have
                  different ways of approaching assigning and certifying a
                  driver passed depending on their size and financial resources.
                </p>
                <h3>Design Limitations and Challenges</h3>
                <p>Some limitations and challenges included:</p>
                <ol id="briefList">

                <p>
                  The task was to create a simple way to assign and track
                  training classes and attendees for different company’s needs
                  like:
                </p>

                <h3>Observations and Interviews</h3>
                <p>
                  Due to limited time, 2 observations and 3 interviews were
                  conducted with only two different companies; however, their
                  needs differed. One didn’t not have another system to for the
                  safety team for drivers to do video training. They did all
                  training in-person. The second company did very little
                  in-person training and primarily relied on drivers signing
                  into an integrated system to do online video trainings, but
                  they wanted our system to allow the managers to assign and
                  track driver’s trainings that are nearing expiration.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Observations involved watching users walk through each step of
                  what they would do on other training management systems and
                  encouraging users mention the software’s pros and cons.
                  Interviews involved tell us about other software’s pros and
                  cons and understanding their differing business processes.

                <p>
                  Based on conversations with customers, this would need to
                  allow for interesting edge cases and plenty of forgiveness for
                  editing, yet be able to guide users through each requirement.
                  Because users would do the same or very similar trainings in
                  the admin panel, a place to configure settings of the
                  software. It contains things like the training name, training
                  description, driving positions that require different
                  trainings, and expiration for the training. All of which
                  users, would rarely edit.

                  Next is the creation of classes based on a training course
                  template. Classes are an instance of a training course that
                  contains a participant roster, date, and time. Due to it’s
                  multi-step process, a wizard UI pattern was thought to be the
                  best approach. Because the previous training module just spit
                  out a list of drivers with the training type, it seemed to
                  cause cognitive overload for users. To solve this, we added a
                  step at the beginning. Users would first select the training
                  type that showed the amount of drivers past due, due within 30
                  days, and due within 90 days for that training type. This
                  acted as a filter and allowed the user to easily focus on one
                  training type. Step 2 users would select who would attend that
                  class and be able to filter by properties like terminal, date,
                  and position. Step 3 users set the trainer, date, time, and
                  location for the training. Last, users reviewed all of the
                  information and confirmed the creation of the class.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lastly, users had to be able to mark whether or not
                  participants attended and passed the class. This was in a
                  separate section of the training module where they could a
                  running history of classes with filters to find classes. The
                  list needed visual indicators to show which classes are
                  pending review and already reviewed classes. Once users
                  clicked on a class, they had to exempt a driver from the
                  roster, fail one, and pass the rest.

                <h3>Findings From Testing</h3>
                <p>
                  5 participants from 3 different companies tested a paper
                  prototype and feedback was very positive. In addition, stock
                  holders from upper management were consulted with the
                  findings. All 5 participants went through the class creation
                  process with ease. 2 participants questioned how to switch
                  from class creation and the running history of classes.
                  However, after a short period were able to see how to which
                  views. When participants were asked to find the Forklift class
                  they created, they did it with ease. When the panel slid out
                  from the right side, 3 participants would there was a lack of
                  visual indicator to understand the top part of the modal panel
                  contained the class details and the second half had the class
                  roster. Once they distinguished this, 5 participants
                  understood how to mark off the attendees, some minor edits
                  were required to help understand what to do.

                <h3>Design Reasoning</h3>
                <p>
                  Because of time restrictions and the positive feedback for
                  participants, development began. The wizard UI pattern for
                  class creation did not require major edits. However, it was
                  required to helping users understand what to do with the
                  roster of drivers, and indicating that the fields were for the
                  class details. It was decided that we would keep the modal
                  panel to show the roster and class details, and to not expand
                  the already large scope of development effort. To distinguish
                  the two parts, we put the two parts into tabs: the first was
                  for the roster and the second for the class details. Plus,
                  participants and stack holders mentioned the need to document
                  any details of the class. For example, trainers might need to
                  state that certain drivers were more engaged than others. This
                  was added to the second tab.
