      <h1>About</h1>
      <h2>Long Story Short</h2>
      <p>
        My love for user experience design stems my desire to create things that
        make someone's day better in a small or large way. It all started when I
        was a little dude enthralled by my favorite cartoons and obsessed with
        creating my own characters with traditional drawing mediums. And then
        one day... my parents bought the familyâ€™s first home computer. I loved
        playing on it and wondered how the UI and interactions were made. I
        thought it would be amazing to create them. Little did I know these two
        interests would lead to learning design and finding clients in need of
        small branding projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        By senior year of college, I was learning some basic front end
        development and found designing basic static posters subpar. Finally,
        upon graduation I decided to go after the career I've been searching for
        since my obsession started that joins my interests in design,
        psychology, and technology: user experience and interface design.
      </p>
      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>
        I graduated from Seton Hill University in May 2017 with a Bachelor's of
        Science in Business Administration (Marketing Specialization), a Graphic
        Design Certificate, and a Psychology minor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since then I have been taking courses on Javascript.
      </p>
      <h2>When Slack Status Is Away</h2>
      <p>
        Outside of work and learning about design/development, I enjoy a handful
        of interests and hobbies. For example, I love cooking especially
        southern comfort food, meditating, yoga, and learning about other
        disciplines. Normally you'll catch me listening to music and might see
        me at a rock, metal, acoustic or electronic concert.
